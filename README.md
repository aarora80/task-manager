# Task Manager App

A modern task management application built using TypeScript, React, Electron, Node.js, AWS, and PostgreSQL. This application provides a desktop client with powerful task management features and a backend API for seamless data storage and retrieval.

## Features

- **Desktop Application**: A cross-platform desktop app built with Electron.
- **User Interface**: A responsive and intuitive UI built with React.
- **Backend API**: A robust RESTful API using Node.js for managing tasks.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for reliable data storage.
- **Cloud Integration**: Deployed on AWS for scalability and high availability.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Desktop App**: Electron
- **Cloud**: AWS

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=14.x)
- PostgreSQL (>=12.x)

### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-manager-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```sh
   cd task-manager-app/frontend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   The application should be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

   ```sh
   cd task-manager-app/backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your PostgreSQL connection details:

   ```plaintext
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase
   ```

4. Run database migrations (if you have any):

   ```sh
   npm run migrate
   ```

5. Start the backend server:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

   The API should be running on `http://localhost:4000`.

### Electron Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```sh
   cd task-manager-app/frontend
   ```

2. Build the Electron application:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

3. Start the Electron application:

   ```sh
   npm run electron
   ```

## Deployment

### AWS Setup

1. **Set up AWS**: Follow AWS documentation to configure your environment and deploy the backend.

2. **Deploy Backend**: Use AWS services like AWS Lambda, EC2, or ECS to deploy your backend API.

3. **Deploy Frontend**: For deploying the frontend, consider using AWS S3 and CloudFront.

## Testing

### Frontend

1. Run unit tests:

   ```sh
   npm test
   ```

2. Run end-to-end tests (if applicable):

   ```sh
   npm run e2e
   ```

### Backend

1. Run unit tests:

   ```sh
   npm test
   ```

2. Run integration tests (if applicable):

   ```sh
   npm run test:integration
   ```
